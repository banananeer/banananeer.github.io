If you haven't read my other post on planning out this project check it out [here](/posts/2022-11-06-planning-static-site-with-lead-capture/). This post builds upon it and walks through the initial setup for the first half of the infrastructure.

Now that the project is planned, development work can begin. I'm no frontend developer or designer so I'll be using a [template](https://templatemo.com/tm-535-softy-pinko) I found of a nice landing page.

1. Setup the repo
2. Setup the infrastructure
3. Setup the pipelines
